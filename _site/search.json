    "title": "Basic Probability theory",
    "section": "Concepts",
    "text": "Concepts\nKey concepts include sample spaces, events, probability axioms, conditional probability, independence, and Bayes’ theorem.\n\n1. Probability:\nProbability measures the likelihood that a specific event will occur. It is a number between 0 and 1:\n\n0 means the event will never happen (impossible event).\n1 means the event is certain to happen.\n\nFor example, if you flip a fair coin, the probability of getting heads is \\(P(Heads)=0.5\\) (or 50%).\nProbability is a way of quantifying how likely an event is to happen. It’s usually expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where:\n0 means the event is impossible (it will never happen). 1 means the event is certain (it will definitely happen).\n\nWhy It’s Important:\nProbability helps us make informed decisions when dealing with uncertainty. It’s used in a wide range of fields—finance, engineering, medicine, etc.—to predict outcomes and risks.\n\n\n\n2. Sample Space (S):\nThe sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.\n\nExample: When rolling a six-sided die, the sample space is: \\(S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\)\n\nThe sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. Example: If you roll a die, the sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nWhy It’s Important:\nUnderstanding the sample space is critical because it defines all possible outcomes and allows us to calculate the probability of specific events happening.\n\n\n\n3. Event (E):\nAn event is a specific outcome or a set of outcomes within the sample space. It’s the occurrence we’re interested in.\n\nExample: In rolling a die, the event “rolling an even number” can be written as: \\(E = \\{2, 4, 6\\}\\)\n\nAn event is a subset of the sample space. It represents the outcome or group of outcomes you’re interested in. Example: If you want to know the probability of rolling an even number on a die, the event (E) is {2, 4, 6}.\n\nWhy It’s Important:\nAn event helps us focus on the outcomes we care about. In the above example, we’re interested in even numbers, and the event is formed by the favorable outcomes (2, 4, and 6).\n\n\n\n4. Probability of an Event:\nTo calculate the probability of an event \\(E\\), use the formula:\n\\[\nP(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}\n\\]\n\nExample: If you want to find the probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die: \\(P(\\text{Even}) = \\frac{3}{6} = 0.5\\)\n\n\nWhy It’s Important:\nThis formula gives you a precise way to quantify how likely a particular event is, which is essential for making predictions or calculating risks.\n\n\n\n5. Complementary Events:\nThe complement of an event \\(E\\) is the event that \\(E\\) does not happen. The probability of the complement is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{Not } E) = 1 - P(E)\n\\] or\n\\[\nP(A') = 1 - P(A)\n\\]\n\nExample: If the probability of rain today is 0.3, the probability that it won’t rain is: \\(P(\\text{No Rain}) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\\)\n\n\nWhy It’s Important:\nComplementary events cover all possible outcomes. If you know the probability of an event happening, you can easily calculate the probability of it not happening.\n\n\n\n6. Independent Events:\nTwo events are independent if the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of the other.\n\nExample: If you flip a coin and roll a die, the result of the coin flip (heads or tails) does not affect what number you roll on the die. So, these events are independent.\n\nFor independent events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the probability of both happening is:\n\\[\nP(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B)\n\\]\nor more simply:\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B)\n\\]\n\nWhy It’s Important:\nUnderstanding independence is key in more complex probability problems, where you need to calculate the likelihood of multiple events occurring together.\n\n\n\n7. Conditional Probability:\nConditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It’s written as \\(P(A|B)\\) (read as “the probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\)”).\nThe formula for conditional probability is:\n\\[\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}, \\quad \\text{for } P(B) &gt; 0\n\\]\n\nExample: If you know that a card drawn from a deck is red, the conditional probability that it’s a heart is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Heart}|\\text{Red}) = \\frac{13}{26} = 0.5\n\\]\n\nWhy It’s Important:\nConditional probability is essential for making predictions when new information is known. It’s widely used in fields like medicine (probability of a disease given a symptom) and machine learning (probability of a classification given data).\n\n\n\n8. Bayes’ theorem:\nThis theorem relates two conditional probabilities and allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. It is expressed as:\n\\[\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\times P(A)}{P(B)}, \\quad \\text{for } P(B) &gt; 0\n\\]\nwhere \\(P(B∣A)\\) is the probability of event \\(B\\) given that event \\(A\\) has occurred, \\(P(A)\\) is the prior probability of event \\(A\\), and \\(P(B)\\) is the total probability of event \\(B\\).\n\nWhy It’s Important:\nBayes’ theorem is specifically used to update the probability of an event based on new evidence or information, effectively allowing for a “reverse” calculation of conditional probabilities."
